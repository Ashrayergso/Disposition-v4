1. **Database Models**: The models defined in `app_name/models.py` such as `Crew`, `Ship`, `Assignment`, `ShipSailingSchedule`, `PositionAndContractLength`, `ShipCrewAllowance`, and `CertificateTypesAndExpiry` are shared across multiple files like `app_name/admin.py`, `app_name/views.py`, `app_name/tests.py`, and `app_name/forms.py`.

2. **URL Names**: The URL names defined in `app_name/urls.py` are used in `app_name/views.py` for redirecting and in templates like `app_name/templates/app_name/crew_list.html` and `app_name/templates/app_name/ship_detail.html` for creating links.

3. **View Functions**: The view functions defined in `app_name/views.py` such as `list_crew_members`, `assign_crew_to_ship` are used in `app_name/urls.py` to map to URL patterns.

4. **HTML Element IDs**: IDs of HTML elements defined in templates like `app_name/templates/app_name/crew_list.html` and `app_name/templates/app_name/ship_detail.html` are used in `app_name/static/app_name/js/main.js` for manipulating DOM elements.

5. **CSS Classes**: CSS classes defined in `app_name/static/app_name/css/main.css` are used in templates like `app_name/templates/app_name/crew_list.html` and `app_name/templates/app_name/ship_detail.html` for styling.

6. **Form Classes**: Form classes defined in `app_name/forms.py` are used in `app_name/views.py` for handling form submissions and in templates for rendering forms.

7. **Settings Variables**: Variables defined in `project_name/settings.py` such as `DATABASES`, `INSTALLED_APPS`, `MIDDLEWARE`, `TEMPLATES`, `STATIC_URL` are used by Django internally across multiple files.

8. **Test Cases**: Test cases defined in `app_name/tests.py` use models, views, forms, and URLs defined in other files.

9. **API Endpoints**: API endpoints defined in `app_name/urls.py` are used in `app_name/views.py` and potentially in `app_name/static/app_name/js/main.js` for AJAX calls.

10. **Requirements**: The packages listed in `requirements.txt` are used across multiple files in the project.
